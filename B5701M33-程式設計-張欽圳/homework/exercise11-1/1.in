"Poison, my boy!" cried King Astyages, much alarmed.
"It is in my hat, underneath the lining," answered Otanes.
Soon another came up and said, "My boy, do you happen to have any gold about you?"
Forty pieces, in my hat, said Otanes.
Otanes answered, I have already told two of your men that I have forty pieces of gold in my hat.
Mount your horse, and my own men will ride with you and see that you reach the end of your journey in safety.
This treasure does not belong to me, for I bought only the ground; but when I offered it to my neighbor he refused it.
