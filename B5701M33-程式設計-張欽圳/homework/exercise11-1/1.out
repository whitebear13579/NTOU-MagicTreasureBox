"Poison, your boy!" cried King Astyages, much alarmed.
"It is in your hat, underneath the lining," answered Otanes.
Soon another came up and said, "Your boy, do you happen to have any gold about you?"
Forty pieces, in your hat, said Otanes.
Otanes answered, I have already told two of your men that I have forty pieces of gold in your hat.
Mount your horse, and your own men will ride with you and see that you reach the end of your journey in safety.
This treasure does not belong to me, for I bought only the ground; but when I offered it to your neighbor he refused it.
